                  <p>By joining the DTA I've taken the plunge into the public sector.
                    I've also discovered everything that <em>can</em> be an acronym or
                    an initialism, <em>will</em> be turned into one. No exceptions.
                    I'm currently leading a product team which is building an open
                    source
                    <a href="https://designsystem.gov.au" target="_blank">design system</a>
                    to help designers and developers across government
                    build fast, accessible, mobile friendly websites. In addition
                    to making it easier for users to interact with the government,
                    we're working to build digital skills across government.
                    A pretty cool mission if you ask me!

                  <p>Shortly before relocating to Australia, I took an opportunity
                    to join Predictable Revenue's development team. While working
                    remotely, I continued to be a champion for user-centered design
                    as I helped deliver new features, chased down and squashed pesky
                    bugs, and sharpened my skills as a technical product manager. I
                    was privileged to work with so many talented developers who took
                    me under their wing and instilled best practice into me.

                  <p>My time leading Predictable Revenue's product team reinforced
                    the value of being surrounded by brilliant
                    people. I worked closely with our executives, advisors,
                    coaches, and development team to successfully launch the
                    first version of
                    <a href="http://predictablerevenue.com/software" target="_blank">our platform</a>.
                    As we grew, I led our early recruitment efforts with our CEO
                    by writing job descriptions, conducting phone and in-person
                    interviews, and overseeing the onboarding process of new
                    hires. And, because there's no such thing as too much data,
                    I learned how to work with SQL to help arm the team with the
                    information we needed to make informed decisions.

                    In these early days, we moved fast and
                    worked closely with our clients to build the foundation of what
                    would become our

                    I built outbound
                    sales campaigns for our clients, A/B tested every
                    variable to improve performance, and worked with our development team
                    on the requirements for the MVP of our platform.

                    outside my normal role as the company grew. I learned a great

              “Accessibility is like a blueberry muffin, you can’t push the berries
              in there afterward”. I talked about how the Australian Government Design
              System has accessibility baked into all its components to make it easy
              for developers and designers to create services for everyone in Australia.

              <em>Launch of the Australian Government Design System</em>
            </h4>
            <p class="talks">Introduced the Australian Government Design System with the DTA’s
              CEO at a public launch in April 2018. In addition to showing off
              our shiny new documentation site, I talked about how design
              systems can help the government build fast, accessible, mobile
              friendly websites that better meet user needs.
