                  <p>By joining the DTA I've taken the plunge into the public sector.
                    I've also discovered everything that <em>can</em> be an acronym or
                    an initialism, <em>will</em> be turned into one. No exceptions.
                    I'm currently leading a product team which is building an open
                    source community to help designers and developers across government
                    transform their agency's services. In addition to making it easier for
                    users to interact with the government, we're working to build
                    digital skills across government. A pretty cool mission if you
                    ask me!

                  <p>Shortly before relocating to Australia, I took an opportunity
                    to join Predictable Revenue's development team. While working
                    remotely, I continued to be a champion for user-centered design
                    as I helped deliver new features, chased down and squashed pesky
                    bugs, and sharpened my skills as a technical product manager. I
                    was privileged to work with so many talented developers who took
                    me under their wing and instilled best practice into me.

                  <p>My time leading Predictable Revenue's product team reinforced
                    the value of being surrounded by brilliant
                    people. I worked closely with our executives, advisors, coaches, and development
                    team to successfully launch the first version of our platform. As
                    we grew, I led our early recruitment efforts with our CEO by writing job
                    descriptions, conducting phone and in-person interviews, and overseeing
                    the onboarding process of new hires.
                    And, because there's no such thing as too much data, I learned SQL to
                    help arm the team with the information we needed to make informed decisions.

                    In these early days, we moved fast and
                    worked closely with our clients to build the foundation of what
                    would become our

                    I built outbound
                    sales campaigns for our clients, A/B tested every
                    variable to improve performance, and worked with our development team
                    on the requirements for the MVP of our platform.

                    outside my normal role as the company grew. I learned a great
                    deal about the Australian tax system as well as what it takes to
                    run a successful business. In my spare time, I served as a mentor and
