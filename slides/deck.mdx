# What is a design system?

---

A design system is a collection of tools and resources for designing and building products and services.

```notes
The stuff an organisation uses to design the stuff it makes
```

---

It’s also the people and processes involved in supporting and maintaining those tools and resources.

---

They’re systems because they are made of parts that can be recombined in many different ways.

```notes
A collection on its own does not make a system. It needs to be modular, reusable, generative
```
